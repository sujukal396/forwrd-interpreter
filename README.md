Forwrd is a stack-based programming language which utilizes postfix notation.

Builtin wrds:
    add -> adds top 2 on stack
    mul -> multiply top 2 on stack
    mod -> modulus of top 2 on stack
    div -> floor division of top 2 on stack
    equ -> checks equality between top 2 on stack
    lss -> checks if 2nd from top is less than top
    gtr -> checks if 2nd from top is greater than top
    lte -> checks if 2nd from top is less than or equal to top
    gte -> checks if 2nd from top is less than or equal to top
    and -> boolean AND
    ior -> boolean OR
    not -> boolean NOT
    bnd -> bitwise AND
    bor -> bitwise OR
    bnt -> bitwise NOT
    bxr -> bitwise XOR
    lsh -> bitwise left shift
    rsh -> bitwise right shift
    swp -> swaps top 2 elements
    def -> define new global variable or function
    fch -> fetch element at nth index from list
    prt -> prints top of stack
    sld -> remove n elements after top
    eva -> execute top of stack
    lst -> pull n values from stack into list
    pop -> pops top element off stack
    dup -> duplicates element n away from top of stack
    clr -> clear stack
